This was, at the time, the most requested feature by agents as well as one of the oldest and hairiest parts of the codebase. </p>\n<p>The second project automated the process of creating neighborhood reports. Redfin agents use these reports to help educate customers about their home. Using my software, agents can quickly show customers how much their home was worth based on local trends and comparable listings.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/redfin/redfin.png" alt="alt text" title="Redfin Logo"></p>\n<h3>Software Used:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>React.js</code> for the frontend</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Java</code> for the backend</p>\n</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{date:"January 01, 2016",path:"/redfin",title:"Redfin"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
