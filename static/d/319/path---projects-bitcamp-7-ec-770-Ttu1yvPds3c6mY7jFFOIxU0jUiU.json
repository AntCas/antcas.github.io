We had retained just a couple team members from the year previous, so we had nearly a dozen key positions we needed to fill.</p>\n<p>We put the word out and held several organizer interest meetings.</p>\n<p>In previous years the organization took a loose structure.</p>\n<p>We implemented a more formal organizational structure and began the process of converting our legal structure from an LLC to a donation eligible non-profit (application accepted in 2017). We simultaneously worked with the IRS to get an extension on our over due taxes and buy us enough time to raise money.</p>\n<p>We became intentional about mentoring new members of the team and helping them grow into more challenging roles. This allowed us to retain over 80% of our senior organizers from 2016 to 2017 compared to just 10% the year before.</p>\n<p>Once the event planning was underway we got serious about fundraising and budgeting. By being highly cost-conscious and creative we were able to go from being over $40,000 behind at our lowest to eventually having a surplus over over $15,000 at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>For details check out my Hackcon talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRK3KmhE_go\">Running a Hackathon in the Red</a> or <a href=\"http://slides.com/anthonycastrio/red#/\">read the slides</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9iQgv2LPZKQVWWE-FGbt5mcpAw93x-d0C-s_gF5Vu8/edit?usp=sharing\">Bitcamp Operations Manual</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/bitcamp/bitcamp.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"Bitcamp logo\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 01, 2016","path":"/projects/bitcamp","title":"Bitcamp","color":"#1a2e33","image":"bitcamp.png"}}},"pageContext":{}}
