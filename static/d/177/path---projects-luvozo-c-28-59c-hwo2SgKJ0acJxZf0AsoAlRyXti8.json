The first project I worked on was a web console for managing fleets of these nurse-bots as they performed their rounds in a nursing-home setting.</p>\n<p>Another product Luvozo builds is a sensor-laden cart which automatically detects tripping hazards as it is pushed around a home.</p>\n<p>I worked on integrating data from all the sensors in the cart in real time so that the information could be piped to a machine learning algorithm and processed.</p>\n<h3>Software Used:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>Python</code> for scripting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Flask</code> for the web-server</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Jinja2</code> for templating</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>Postgres</code> for a robust database</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>SQLite</code> for a quick and easy database</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 01, 2016","path":"/projects/luvozo","title":"Luvozo","color":"#246478","image":"luvozo.png","location":"College Park, MD"}}},"pageContext":{}}
