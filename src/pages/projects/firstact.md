FirstAct was born in the Fall of 2019 as a service to connect local music acts in Montreal to undersold shows.

My partner on the First Act project is [Harrison Goldstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisongold/) a talent buyer for Webster Hall turned Data Scientist.

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic made our original business model infeasible in the short term leading to us pivoting the project to become a podcast and newsletter.

If you're interested in stories about breaking into the music industry, then give a listen to the [First Act Podcast](https://anchor.fm/first-act-podcast).
