Loom is a chrome extension for creating quick videos.

Itâ€™s incredibly handy for customer service, sales, bug reports and a dozen other use cases. The company is backed by Slack and General Catalyst.

While at Loom I rebuilt their onboarding process and their settings panel in React. Both pages required extensive rewrites touching every part of the technology stack.
