Luvozo builds robots for senior living.

During my time at Luvozo I worked on two National Science Foundation backed projects improving the lives of senior citizens.

Luvozoâ€™s flagship product is a robot which could automatically perform rounds in a senior living center. The first project I worked on was a web console for managing fleets of these nurse-bots as they performed their rounds in a nursing-home setting.

Another product Luvozo builds is a sensor-laden cart which automatically detects tripping hazards as it is pushed around a home.

I worked on integrating data from all the sensors in the cart in real time so that the information could be piped to a machine learning algorithm and processed.

###Software Used:
* `Python` for scripting

* `Flask` for the web-server

* `Jinja2` for templating

* `Postgres` for a robust database

* `SQLite` for a quick and easy database
