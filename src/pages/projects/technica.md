Technica is the largest all-ladies hackathon in the world, held annually at the University of Maryland, College Park.

In 2015 I helped organize the first Technica hackathon. I built a team of mentors and volunteers and organized them during the event. I also raised $5,000 in funding and helped manage logistics. 

Over 500 students attended our inaugural event.

##Mentors:

I reached out to hundreds of mentors in the DC-area and beyond and got 50 excited people to sign up to mentor our hackers.

##Volunteers:

Coordinating volunteers took multiple months of planning. 

Once the event drew close we held a series of volunteer interest meetings where we got people excited about the event and how they could help. In the week before the event I led walkthroughs of the venue in order to make sure that volunteers were familiar with the venue and ready to help out on the day of.

##Bonus
[Tech+X GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/116S7IZUc6esXZX-k3WWgjzdffxnpBE1gFtdgTFAnsHo/edit?usp=sharing) was an introductory GitHub workshop I gave around Halloween time during the lead up to the second Technica.
