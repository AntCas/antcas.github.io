Loom builds a chrome extension for creating quick videos. Itâ€™s incredibly handy for customer service, sales, and bug reports just to name a few use cases. The company is backed by Slack and UpFront ventures among others.

While at Loom I rebuilt their on boarding process and their settings panel in React. Both pages required extensive rewrites which touched every part of the technology stack.
