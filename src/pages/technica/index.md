Technica is the largest all ladies hackathon in the world, held annually at the University of Maryland, College Park.

In 2015 I helped organize the first Technica hackathon. I was in finding mentors and volunteers and organizing them during the event. I also raised $5,000 in funding and helped manage logistics. 

Mentors:

I reached out to hundreds of mentors in the DC-area and beyond and got 50 excited people to sign up to mentor our hackers.

Volunteers:

Coordinating volunteers took several months of planning. 

Once the event drew close we held a series of volunteer interest meetings where we got people excited about the event and how they could help. In the week before the event I led walkthroughs of the venue in order to make sure that volunteers were familiar with the venue and ready to help out on the day of.

Once the day of the event came, we welcomed over 500 attendees for our 24 hour event. 

Bonus: [Tech+X GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/116S7IZUc6esXZX-k3WWgjzdffxnpBE1gFtdgTFAnsHo/edit?usp=sharing) an introductory GitHub workshop I gave around Halloween time during the lead up to the second Technica.
