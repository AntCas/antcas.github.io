Luvozo build robots for senior living.

During my time at Luvozo I worked on two National Science Foundation backed projects improving the lives of senior citizens.

Luvozoâ€™s flagship product was a robot which could automatically perform rounds in a senior living center . The first project I worked on was a web console for managing fleets of these nurse-bots as they perform their rounds in a nursing-home setting.

Another product Luvozo built was a sensor-laden cart which could automatically detect tripping hazards as it was pushed around a home. I worked on integrating data from all the sensors in the cart in real time so that the information could be piped to a machine learning algorithm and processed.
