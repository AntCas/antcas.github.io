My contributions included major frontend and backend features including a couple large refactors. I implemented UI, created new API endpoints, wrote tests, and optimized DB queries.</p>\n<p>As a user of the product myself I also made significant contributions to the product direction to create a very polished final product for anyone planning online or offline events.</p>\n<h3>Email Queue System</h3>\n<p>I built out an email queue system using Postgres and Sendgrid that enabled us to have a lot of flexibility with our transactional email sending.</p>\n<h3>Product Hunt Launch</h3>\n<p>I took the lead on launching <a href=\"/blog/2020-2-19-tools-and-hacks-for-your-product-hunt-launch\">Mixily on Product Hunt</a>, putting together the majority of the assets, the copy, and marketing the launch. We received over 350 upvotes and were the #4 Product of the Day.</p>\n<h3>Client Feedback</h3>\n<p>\"Anthony did great work. He implemented features, fixed bugs, and went above and beyond to polish user experience and suggest business-level improvements. He picked up new technologies quickly, touching all parts of the code from the database schema to the CSS. I can recommend him highly for a full-stack web developer position.\"</p>\n<p>-- Andrew Badr, CEO  Mixily, March 2020</p>\n<h3>Software used:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Postgres</code>, <code>React</code>, <code>Django</code>, <code>Sendgrid</code></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 01, 2019","path":"/projects/mixily","title":"Mixily","color":"#f4b395","image":"mixily.svg","location":"Mexico City, MX"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
