    <h2>Inquiry</h2>
	<p>
	Over the last few decades, the cost of tuition paid by students studying at American colleges and universities has risen to be the highest in the world as well as the highest in American History. Fifty years ago Americans were able to fund their education through part-time work and even today students studying in many European countries pay essentially nothing for a comparable education. So what has driven the rising costs of education in the United States and what should be done to reverse this trend?Additionally, why is it that American students continue to pay a premium for their education and can they continue to do so?
	</p>
	<p>
	As a student at the University of Maryland, College Park and especially as a student paying out of state tuition the issue at hand is extremely relevant to me. I hope that by exploring this issue I can uncover why the costs associated with college have risen to such a degree in general as well as determine if I have personally made a sound economic decision by deciding to go to college. Many students decide to go to college on the advise of their preceding generation, but the economic picture has changed significantly since our parents were in college. 
	</p>
	<p>
	According to the latest statistics produced by the National Center for Education Statistics, students in the United States paid an average of $20,234 in tuition, fees, room, and board across all types of institutions during the 2012 to 2013 school year. During the 1982 to 1983 school year students paid an average of $9,138 in inflation-adjusted dollars. This represents an increase of over 120% in inflation-adjusted costs over just the last 30 years. The final price-tag on a year of college at public institutions has risen more than 5% faster than it has at private institutions.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another way of analyzing how fast tuition has risen is to compare it with other rising costs such as food prices and health-care. According to Michelle Jamrisko and Ilan Kolet of Bloomberg Business, during the same period of time in which the average cost of food rose by %244 and medical expenses grew by %601, tuition and fees skyrocketed by an astounding %1,120. Overall college tuition and fees have grown at a rate four times faster than the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index since 1978. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The burgeoning costs of education at American colleges and universities are leaving a continuously increasing number of graduates with a continuously increasing amount of debt. According to Matthew Reed and Debbie Cochrane of the Institute for College Access & Success, approximately 70% of students who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 2013 also graduated with an average of $28,400 in student loan debt. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The total debt owed by the American public on their student loans has ballooned into a crisis situation. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau total student debt grew to 1.2 trillion dollars in 2013 and student debt has now become the second largest out of all forms of consumer debt. The largest form of consumer debt is home mortgages. According to Rohit Chopra of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over 1 trillion dollars of that debt is Federally held while the remainder is held by private loan agencies.
	</p>
	<p>
	Students studying in Germany, meanwhile, paid exactly nothing for tuition or fees and were responsible only for their living expenses. According to the 2014/15 report on student fees produced by the Eurydice network on education systems, students studying at public universities in France paid a maximum of 189 Euros or about 200 US dollars per year. Students studying at private Universities in Europe (as in the United States) can expect to pay more, however the costs are still significantly less than those faced by students studying at private and even public Universities in the United States. For example, students studying at private institutions in France paid no more than the equivalent of 6,500 USD over the 2014/15 school year. 
	</p>
	<p>
	So why is there such an incredible difference between the cost of earning a degree at a college in the United States versus earning a degree in other developed nations with comparable education systems? European universities are more affordable than those in the United States primarily because of a much more comprehensive system of federal subsidization. However, some argue that the rising costs of a college education in the United States is also due to subsidization by the federal government. As previously stated, the majority of student loan debt is held by the federal government and is heavily subsidized. Getting student loans from the federal government is much cheaper than from private sources and, some argue, may be causing the demand for a college education to rise to levels which are unsustainable by the education marketplace.
	</p>
	<p>
	Among those who argue that the rising costs of education are a result of government subsidization is Megan McArdle of Newsweek. She opined that by subsidizing student loans we have upset the balance of supply and demand in the education marketplace and thereby caused prices to rise artificially. According to McArdle, “In a normal market, prices would be constrained by the disposable income available to pay them. But we’ve bypassed those constraints by making subsidized student loans widely available.” Ms. McArdle argues that there is an indirect cause and effect relationship between federal subsidization of student loans and tuition and that fewer subsidies would lead to lower overall expenses for college students. This oft-repeated argument is known as the “Bennet Hypothesis” because it was first suggested by the then-Secretary of Education William J. Bennet in 1987. However, under closer scrutiny the argument seems to be based on speculation and is refuted by the data that has been gathered on the subject.
	</p>
	<p>
	David L. Warren, the president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, gathered the results of a number of studies which refute the notion that there is any correlation between the government subsidization of student loans and the price-tag attached to college tuition. Among the institutions he quoted were the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics, the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education, and the Government Accountability Office all of which had independently come to the conclusion through their gathering of data that there was no evidence of a correlation between the degree of loan subsidization and the raising of the cost of tuition. If we accept that subsidization does not appear to be directly harmful as an agent of increasing college tuition costs, can we conclude that it is actually beneficial in decreasing those costs?
	</p>
	<p>
	Before we can do that we must examine whether an increasingly educated workforce is valuable at both the individual and national levels. The traditional view is that a college educated workforce is inherently more valuable than a workforce without a college education, and that at the individual level a college degree is an investment that will pay off in increased lifetime-earning potential. According to an economics paper written in 2014 by Federal Reserve Bank of New York economists Jaison Abel and Richard Deitz a bachelor's degree has consistently generated an average return of %15 since the year 2000. Although tuition has risen faster than inflation while wages have simultaneously been dropping, the situation has been much worse for those without any form of higher education. In short, although the return on investment for a bachelor's has been going down, the costs of not having the degree have increased faster.
	</p>
	<p>
	Some believe that college has already become more expensive than it is worth. Entrepreneurs such Peter Thiel and James Altucher argue that the rate of return is inflated because college naturally attracts more ambitious people who would have made more money regardless. In a blog post Mr Altucher argues that the opportunity cost of attending college far outweighs the increased earnings potential. “Right now most motivated kids who have the interest and resources to go to college think it’s the only way to go if they want a good job. If those same kids decided to not go to college my guess is they would quickly close the gap.” He further states that merely investing the six figure sums many pay for college would yield a return of over a million dollars, significantly more than the approximately $800,000 lifetime return predicted by the college board.
	</p>
	<p>
	Peter Thiel, motivated by principles similar to those that James Altucher suggests, has created a fund which pays ambitious would-be-students to forgo college for at least two years and pursue their most ambitious goals. He offers a stipend of $100,000 to about 20 ambitious young adults each year through the Thiel Foundation. According to the Thiel Fellowship website, fellows have created over 100 million dollars in total economic activity through their various pursuits and founded over 58 organizations which currently employ over 200 people.
	</p>
	<p>
	Despite the arguments made by Mr Thiel and Mr Altucher, college remains a good investment for the majority of students. The majority of college students, more likely than not, would not have the ambition described by Mr Thiel and Mr Altucher as necessary to offset the penalties the current labor market inflicts on those who lack a college diploma. Overall, an educated workforce is good for the economy and an educated worker tends to fair better financially than their less educated counterparts even as the costs of their education increase. It does seem, however, that we will soon reach a turning point where the education equation stops making sense for a majority of college students. These students will either have taken on an insurmountable amount of debt or will have to make the decision not to attend college.
	</p>
	<p>
	One option for approaching this dilemma is to let market forces correct the imbalance between supply and demand. Once prices rise (given a simplistic model of the economy) demand should decrease. Unfortunately this likely will not be how the actual market will respond. Josh Freedman, a contributor to Forbes Magazine, discussed in an article the fact that demand for a college education does not decrease when prices rise. In economic terms, demand for education is inelastic. He states that “all else equal, in theory the increasing price of college over the last forty years should have resulted in fewer people attending. But the exact opposite has occurred: the number of people has increased dramatically.” He argues that allowing tuition to rise merely limits access to education for lower income students; it doesn't reduce demand and it won't solve the current student debt crisis.
	</p>
	<p>
	The other option, which has been successful in Europe for many years, is for the federal and/or state governments to cover the majority of the cost of tuition at public schools. President Obama announced in January that he plans to make tuition at community colleges free for two years. The plan, if approved, would cost of about $6 billion dollars a year to execute as estimated by the White House. The Federal government, for comparison, spent close to 69 billion dollars across all financial aid programs in 2013 according to the New America Foundation. And according to the National Center for Education Statistics the tuition charged at all public universities totaled to approximately 53 billion dollars. Theoretically, the federal government could afford to cover 100% of tuition costs at public Universities today simply by reallocating the funds it currently spends on it's financial aid programs and it would still have 14 billion dollars left over. This would of course leave many students attending private schools with less funding, but competing with a free alternative might incentive public universities to lower their tuition costs as well. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Although the equation to determine whether the federal government could afford to subsidize all higher education at public colleges and universities is straightforward, there are many confounding factors to be considered. It may be that funding education could have unforeseen and adverse effects on the economy or that any initiative would cost significantly more than this simple estimate suggests. Of course, the issue is very political as well given how many powerful and institutional fingers are in the education honey pot and how many people any changes made would effect. So, should the federal government fully subsidize higher education at public colleges and universities? In order to answer this question authoritatively I will need to research the issue further.

    <h2>Argument</h2>
	<p>
Over the last few decades the cost of tuition paid by students studying at American colleges and universities has risen to be the highest in the world as well as the highest in American History. Fifty years ago Americans were able to fund their education through part-time work and even today students studying in many European countries pay essentially nothing for a comparable education. Tuition has risen dramatically in America primarily because of a simple imbalance between supply and demand, demand for a college education has simply outstripped supply. This problem has been further complicated and exasperated by the misappropriation of federal subsidies currently in place. I hope to convince you in this argument to support the full abolition of tuition at public universities within the United States. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The demand for a college education has increased primarily because the value of having a college degree has increased. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, even after accounting for the price of tuition and opportunity costs, a bachelor's degree is worth approximately $300,000 to a student (Abel, Deitz). According to David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Economics department, that figure may be closer to $500,000 (Autor). As high as these figures are, more students have likely heard the value of college quoted closer to $1,000,000, making that number more relevant as the perceived value of attending college (Fottrell). Naturally, this has caused the number of degree seekers to rise as students attempt to take capture that value.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, the value of a college education has been driven at least as much by the falling wages of those who do not hold a degree as it has been driven by rising wages for college graduates. According to the latest survey by the Pew Research Center and data from the U.S. Census Bureau, while wages for college graduates rose from $38,833 inflation-adjusted dollars in 1965 to $45,500 in 2012, the typical high school graduates earnings fell from $31,384 in 1965 to $28,000 in 2013 (The Ris.).
	</p>
	<p>
	Since 1965 the earnings gap has more than doubled and since 1979 high-school graduates have gone from making 77% of what college graduates made to only 62% of what the average college graduate makes today.  We are facing an increasingly wide wage gap in the United States between the educational haves and have-nots. If we want our less fortunate citizens to have a chance at pulling themselves up and pursuing a better life for themselves and their families, then we must give them an opportunity to do so. The strong correlation between income gap and a college education suggests that the best way of closing the gap would be to make college free for anyone who wants to go.
	</p>
	<p>
	Unfortunately, universities have been unable to meet the increasing demand for an education by increasing their enrollment. Instead they have raised tuition prices in a straightforward play to the market forces of supply and demand. The federal government has recognized the value of a college degree and encouraged citizens to pursue an education through the use of subsidized tuition since the passing of the GI bill. In order to allow more students to afford college, the federal government has subsidized loans and created or increased grant programs. Federal subsidization has risen from 48.2 billion dollars per year in 1975 to 81 billion dollars per year today (Campos).
	</p>
	<p>
	Federal programs reduce the out of pocket cost of college for students and encourage more students to apply for a college education. The increased demand and newly available funds incentivize universities to raise their prices further, thus creating a cycle of rising costs and increasing student debt. Additionally, student loans are not like other forms of debt because they are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Unlike other loans, mortgages for example, there is no way for student loan borrowers to default on their loans, they are stuck with them until they have been payed in nearly all circumstances, although there are some rarely granted exceptions. (11 USCA)
	</p>
	<p>
	Debtors who wish to discharge their student loans in bankruptcy must show that repayment would cause them an undue hardship. However, undue hardship is an ambiguous term that is not currently defined by any relevant laws. In order to deal with this ambiguity courts have adopted a three part test called the “Brunner Test”. To be granted an exception a debtor must be unable to maintain a minimal standard of living, have made a good faith attempt to repay the loans, and lack any hope of repaying the loans for the foreseeable future. In practice, such exceptions are made for less than half of cases which go to court. Jason Iuliano of the Princeton Department of Politics found that only 39% of cases received even a partial discharge of their student debt (Iuliano).
	</p>
	<p>
	According to the latest statistics produced by the National Center for Education Statistics, students in the United States paid an average of $20,234 in tuition, fees, room, and board across all types of institutions during the 2012 to 2013 school year. During the 1982 to 1983 school year students paid an average of $9,138 in inflation-adjusted dollars. This represents an increase of over 120% in inflation-adjusted costs over just the last 30 years. The final price-tag on a year of college at public institutions has risen more than 5% faster than it has at private institutions. (Tuition.) 
	</p>
	<p>
	Another way of analyzing how fast tuition has risen is to compare it with other rising costs such as food prices and health-care. According to a report by Michelle Jamrisko and Ilan Kolet in Bloomberg Business, during the same period of time in which the average cost of food rose by 244% and medical expenses grew by 601%, tuition and fees skyrocketed by an astounding 1,120%. Overall, college tuition and fees have grown at a rate four times faster than the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index since 1978 (Jamrisko, Kolet). According to Matthew Reed and Debbie Cochrane of the Institute for College Access & Success, approximately 70% of students who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 2013 also graduated with an average of $28,400 in student loan debt (Reed, Cochrane). Given how fast tuition prices have risen to unprecedented levels, it is unsurprising that students are taking on unprecedented levels of debt in order to afford an education.
	</p>
	<p>
	One way of ending this cycle would be to cut all subsidization and make loans dischargeable in bankruptcy. Removing the artificial constraints that have been placed on the market could allow the market to eventually re-stabilize. Dischargeable loans are much riskier for lenders. If students are unable to get loans because of the amount of risk they present, fewer students will be able to enroll. Higher tuition will also discourage students from enrolling. These students would have to find new ways of entering the job force. Declining enrollment and an increase in alternatives would cause the price of tuition to stabilize at true market rates over time. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Unfortunately, in the near to medium term, this policy would cause a lot of turbulence in our economy. Furthermore, it would price out students from low-income households and students who wished to study subjects with low expected financial returns. Education is not entirely about getting a great job and we should not be making it harder for low income citizens to move out of poverty.
	</p>
	<p>
	The solution I am proposing is to shift the burden of education costs from students to taxpayers. This may not seem fair at first to the taxpayers who do not go to college, but there are at least two reasons why this is not a major issue. First, college graduates make more money and therefore they will pay more taxes over their lifetime and second, there are many government services we pay for as a whole which are only used by a few. Everything subsidized by the government can not benefit every tax payer equally, but we should promote the initiatives which improve the nation for all of us. As it stands, student debt is a burden on the economy and solutions to this crisis which limit social mobility would be detrimental.
	</p>
	<p>
	The total debt owed by the American public on their student loans has ballooned into a crisis situation. According to Rohit Chopra of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau total student debt grew to 1.2 trillion dollars in 2013 and student debt has now become the second largest out of all forms of consumer debt. The largest form of consumer debt held by borrowers in the United States is home mortgages. Over 1 trillion dollars of student loan debt is Federally held while the remainder is held by private loan agencies. (Chopra)
	</p>
	<p>
	Meanwhile, students studying in Germany now pay exactly nothing for tuition or fees and are responsible only for their living expenses. According to the 2014/15 report on student fees produced by the Eurydice network on education systems, students studying at public universities in France paid a maximum of 189 Euros or about 200 US dollars per year. Students studying at private Universities in Europe (as in the United States) can expect to pay more, however the costs are still significantly less than those faced by students studying at private and even public universities in the United States. For example, students studying at private institutions in France paid no more than the equivalent of 6,500 United States dollars over the 2014/15 school year, significantly less than many students in the United States pay in a single semester at public universities (Natio.). 
	</p>
	<p>
	Free, or at least very affordable, education is the norm across most of Europe, but I'd like to focus on Germany here as Germany is a country which has just recently fully abolished tuition after attempting to introduce it. The initiative introduced in Germany in 2006 to allow universities to charge college students for tuition was met with harsh criticism, which eventually led to the state-by-state repeal of tuition fees. Lower Saxony was the last state to officially abolish tuition for both domestic and international students in October of 2014 year (Buchanan).
	</p>
	<p>
	The German university system works a bit differently than the system we have in the United States. The German system is a bit cheaper to run due to a few key philosophical and structural differences about what it means to be a university in Germany. In addition, the Germans pay fairly high federal income taxes at 42% for persons making between $50,000 and $250,000 per year (Personal). However, I do not think that these differences are so great that Germany can not be used as an example of what we can do here in the United States.
	</p>
	<p>
	One of the main differences which make a German university cheaper to operate are the lack of amenities beyond what is needed to maintain an academic environment. The amenities we've become used to at American colleges do not exist at German institutions for the most part. German universities, for one, lack the classic college campus that we tend to associate with college here in the United States. German campuses tend to be dispersed among several buildings throughout a city and lack any real "campus" feel. The myriad clubs, events, sports facilities, and other amenities that have become common at universities in the United States are not present at the majority of German universities. Regardless of their merits, it saves money not to have these extras.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another reason why German universities may be less expensive to operate than their counterparts in the United States to is a lack of the growing administrative bloat many universities in the United States have been experiencing. Paul F Campos, a law professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder wrote an article for the NY times in which he argues that the rising costs of college is at least partly due to increasing administrative costs. Campos wrote that "according to the Department of Education data, administrative positions at colleges and universities grew by 60 percent between 1993 and 2009". In the California State University system for example, according to statistics Campos gathered in his article, the number of administrators grew by 221% from 1975 to 2008. The number of tenure-tracked positions added in that same time grew by approximately one tenth the growth rate of the administration. (Campos)
	</p>
	<p>
	Fortunately, the additional tax burden required to subsidize education in the United States would be small to nonexistent if subsidization is implemented correctly. In fact, federal subsidization of the full costs of higher education at public universities could be accomplished with no increase in net in tax revenue over time. As it stands today, the federal government currently spends more dollars across all financial aid programs than is charged at all public universities in the United States. We could effectively make tuition at all public universities free for less money than we are currently paying to partially subsidize college costs. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In 2013 the federal government spent close to 69 billion dollars across all financial aid programs according to the New America Foundation, and according to the National Center for Education Statistics the tuition charged at all public universities totaled to approximately 53 billion dollars. Therefore, the federal government could theoretically afford to cover 100% of tuition costs at public Universities today simply by reallocating the funds it currently spends on it's financial aid programs and it would still have 14 billion dollars left over. Taking this course of action would leave some students attending private schools with less funding, but competing with a free alternative would have the additional incentive of encouraging those private universities to lower their tuition costs as well. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Some critics of subsidization, such as Chris Edwards and Neil McCluskey of the CATO Institute, argue that subsidization leads to limitations on freedom of speech through the enforcement of regulations on course materials at universities (McCluskey, Edwards). However, The United States government is made up of multiple entities and persons with vary different viewpoints. To claim that the government has their hand in education in order to indoctrinate students with certain viewpoints is unlikely given that government itself does not often come to a consensus on what viewpoints are correct. Furthermore, the government is already in the business of subsidizing education costs. There is nothing stopping the United States government from attempting to regulate what materials are being taught at universities now. The claim that subsidization will lead to increased regulation is unfounded, it may happen regardless.
	</p>
	<p>
	Outlawing tuition at public universities in the United States would have to be accompanied by actual laws regulating tuition charges for public university students as has been done successfully in Germany, otherwise the universities could decide to pocket the subsidies and increase tuition as they have with government subsidies in the past. What we need is a clean break from the viscous cycle of increasing subsidies, tuition rates, and student debt. Lowering tuition at public universities would in turn encourage private universities to charge less as well in order to stay competitive in a radically changed market. This would hopefully lead to a new circle, a virtuous circle of stabilizing, decreasing tuition and decreasing rates of student loan debt.
	</p>
	<p>
	In fact, the United States has already taken its first step towards free higher education. President Obama announced in January a proposal that would make community college free for all students who maintain a 2.5 GPA and "maintain steady progress" towards a degree. The costs of tuition will be split between the federal and state governments. The federal government will pay around 75% of the cost of tuition while participating states will pay around 25% of tuition costs. The Obama administration estimates that this program will save 9 million students an average of $3,800 year if it is adopted by all states. (Zero)
	</p>
	<p>
	This plan, if put into action, may prove to be the perfect litmus test for full tuition subsidization in the United States. If it works at our community colleges, if colleges are prevented from abusing the system, and if students are able to graduate debt free and engage in more meaningful ways with the economy, then the next logical step may be to expand the program to 4 year public universities. A tuition free system, once in place, will take off the ball and chain currently clasped to the ankles of our new grads and spur increased economic activity.
	</p>
	<p>
	The student debt crisis has now gone past the point where it can be safely reined by market forces. The current system of subsidization has made the situation worse, but cutting subsidization off now would merely the cement the already developing division between the wealthy who can afford education and the poor who cannot. Student debt is a drag on the U.S. economy and is putting us at a disadvantage to countries like Germany where education is considered a civil right. The need for a radical change has become apparent and political entities such as the Obama Administration have begun to take action. If we do not want the movement towards a freer and more meritocratic America to die out before it has even been born, we must collectively support the move towards full subsidization and we must encourage our politicians to do the same. If we move now, free tuition at public universities can become the future of education in the United States.

    I'm a student at the University of Maryland, College Park. As a student and taxpayer, the rising cost education in the United States is a very important issue to me. I hope that by collecting this information in one place, it will be easier for concerned citizens to develop an informed opinion about the issue, and perhaps through collective action we can instigate change in the system. <br/> <br/>
